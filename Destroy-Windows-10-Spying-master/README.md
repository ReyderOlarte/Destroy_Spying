## Determination of the system language
We get the language from the command-line arguments to the function:
```c#
private string _GetLang(IEnumerable<string> args)
```
Next we set language in function:
```c#
private void SetLanguage(string currentlang = null)
```
And call function to change the language:
```c#
private void ChangeLanguage()
```
